# Project Title:
Analyzing Car Sales in Norway | Sales Dashboard (Power BI Project)

# Description
This Car Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI) visualizes Norway’s car market using cleaned Excel data. It highlights units sold, total revenue, market share, brand performance, top models, and sales trends, providing quick insights into top-selling brands and overall sales growth.


# Key Insights and Features:
•	Total Units Sold: 1.34M cars sold across different brands.
•	Total Revenue: Generated revenue of ₹120M+ (example figure).
•	Top Performing Brands: Volkswagen, Toyota, Ford, Audi, BMW, and Hyundai.
•	Market Share Analysis: Visualized through an interactive pie chart showing brand-wise contribution.
•	Top 5 Models by Revenue: Identified best-selling car models by revenue.
•	Sales Trend: Line chart displaying monthly/quarterly sales trend for performance tracking.
•	Brand Market Value: Bar chart comparing brand performance in terms of sales and revenue.
•	Dynamic Filters: Dashboard includes slicers for filtering by brand and category.


# Why This Project Stands Out:
•	Built an end-to-end interactive dashboard using Power BI with clear, professional layout.
•	Real-world business problem: Car sales performance analysis for strategic decision-making.
•	Clean data transformation using Power Query (ETL process).
•	Applied data modeling, DAX calculations, and custom visuals for deeper insights.
•	Demonstrates data storytelling skills through visualization and key KPIs.
